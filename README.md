## Project Structure

src/main/java/: This folder is typically used to store the main Java source code files for your application. It contains the actual implementation of your project's functionality.

src/main/resources/: This folder is used to store resources that are needed for your application's execution, such as configuration files, properties files, and other non-Java files.

src/test/java/: This folder is used to store the test source code files for your automated tests. It contains the test classes and methods that verify the functionality of your application.

src/test/resources/: This folder is used to store test-specific resources, such as test data files or test configuration files.

JRE System Library: This is a system library provided by your Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and contains the standard Java classes and libraries required for your project to compile and run.

Maven Dependencies: This folder contains all the external libraries and dependencies that your project uses. These dependencies are managed by Maven, which is a build and dependency management tool.

reports: This folder is usually used to store the reports generated by test automation tools after test execution. It can contain HTML, XML, or other report formats.

src: This is the main source folder that contains both main and test folders.

target: This folder is created by Maven and is used to store the output of the build process, such as compiled classes and test results.

testdata: This folder can be used to store any test-specific data files that are needed during test execution.

test-output: This folder can be used to store any test-related output, logs, or screenshots generated during test execution.

pom.xml: This is the Project Object Model (POM) file for Maven, which defines the project configuration, dependencies, and other settings required for building and managing the project.

testng.xml: This is the configuration file for TestNG, a testing framework used for organizing and running automated tests.
